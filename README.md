# Malware Detection using XGBoost
Windows is one of the most vulnerable OSes, thereby making its PE files prone to malicious content. Hence i have developed a code to check for malicious content in one's PE files.
It is a client-server architecture where the client can send files to the serves to check if the PE files present in the client's system is malicious or not. The ML algorithm used to train the malicious and benign files are XGBoost. I have downloaded several malicious and benign files from the internet and extracted features from these files for which the code is present in "extraction.py". You will have to download several malicious and benign files inorder to run extraction.py and replace  the path of the downloaded files according to your use in "extraction.py". 
"MDServer.py" is to be run in the server terminal whereas "MDclient.py" is to be run in the client's terminal where an User-Interface pops up and the client types in the name of the file to be sent to the server and is checked for malicious content. The client-server architecture established will facilitate the transfer of files from the client to the server. Once the file is sent, it's features are extracted and prediction is done using the model trained using XGBoost.The prediction is then transferred to the client to show if the file is malignant or benign.
